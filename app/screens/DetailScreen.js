      <Text>Hi guys! This was our fun little HackIllinois Project. Created by Sophia Zhuang(AKA sopheets), 
        Kelsi Padalia(Kelso), and Anjali Vadlamudi(Anjalo)! This app lets businesses like cafe bene or kams, for example, 
        create spotify playlists that visitors can add to. It will give the people in the room a general idea of the music vibe
        and people can contribute their favorite songs to it! The business can then filter their music they are willing to add beforehand
        so songs that fit these criterias will automatically be added!
